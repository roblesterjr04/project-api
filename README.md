# Project API (PAPI)
An API CMS based off of Laravel

## Installation (for now)
1. Install contents of the laravel directory to your web root.
2. Set database configuration in the .ENV file.
3. Go to /auth/register to create an account. Once an installation program is written, this page will be removed.

### Notes
* For now, application MUST reside in the ROOT of your website. It will most likely not show html assets correctly if installed in a subdirectory.
* The entire thing is still under development... So its not even functional other than logging in and seeing our pretty admin theme.
